We enjoyed our **first group lunch** to celebrate the Lantern Festival together! It was a festive hotpot gathering where everyone shared their plans and dreams for the coming monthsâ€”covering everything from exciting **research projects** to personal goals for the year.

 We look forward to the collaborations and camaraderie to come!
